##Why we use Python?
###You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. 
####Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. 
###You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program.
####Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.

##How to use Python efficiently?
###Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. 
#### It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs
